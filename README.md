# Password Generator

A simple Python script I created to generate passwords for my personal use. It's not particularly sophisticated, but it serves my needs and might be useful to others.

## What it does
- Generates passwords of any length
- Lets you choose character types (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Copies passwords to your clipboard automatically
- Optionally saves passwords with website names

## How to use
1. Run the script:
`python password_generator.py`
2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter password length
   - Choose which character types to include
   - Optionally save with a website name
3. Your password will be displayed on screen, copied to clipboard and saved to saved_password.txt if requested
